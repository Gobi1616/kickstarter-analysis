## Overview of Project

### Purpose
the purpose of this porject is to identify the how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. Table representing the total counts of successful, failed, live and canceled crowdfunding campaign outcomes from 2009 to 2017 in 19 different countries. The crowdfunding campaigns were undertaken in 9 different parent categories and 41 sub-categories of funding resources. The successful rate of the campaigns in all categories is 53% and the failed, canceled and live rates are 37%, 8.5% and 1.5%. In contrast, the total count of failed, canceled and live outcome is 47% (1929 counts) , and the count of successful is 53% (2185) where there is small difference. 

## Analysis and Challenges
Based on the data set it is straight forward analysis to encounter. But, it was difficult to understand why the ‘live’ outcome has been has been limited three months from January to March since 2009 to 2017. It is hard to predict why the dataset not available for rest of month to make a strategic decision. 

Possible challenges in future:
Due this global Covid19 pandemic situation government restriction and protocols are high priority and not predictable to run campaigns. This will be big challenge. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Based on May, June and July months are the best preforming months of theater outcomes by their Launch dates. . The successful rate of the campaigns in theater category is 61% and thetotal sum of failed and canceled rates is 39%.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Higher the goal ranges higher the failing rates outcomes. Lower goal range campaigns has the best perfmoning rate than the high range.  

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

But, it was difficult to undersatand about why the successful outcome has been has been very low from 2009 to 2013. It led to deep dive to find the exact reson why the perfomance is very low and the resources are limited to find exact solution to to avaoid the unnecessary factors and to improve the ways to attarct more funds. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Theater category has best success outcome of 33% among the all other parent category from 2009 to 2017. The successful outcome of the theater category is steady and always greater than the failed and canceled outcome from January to December.  The successful rate of the campaigns in all categories is 61% and the sum of failed and canceled rates is 39%. In contrast, it concludes that the outcome of theater category generated the more funds and it is best performing category. 

The below chart shows that May, June and July months are the best preforming months of theater outcomes by their Launch dates. Successful outcome rate is average from January to April and, later on August to December, and the gap between successful and failed rate is less, and it is very low in the month of December. The months which are under less performance has to be considered in order to improve the successful outcome over the next years. In a cycles from August to April, the successful rate declining and less, where the failed rate is almost steady and constant.  


- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Based on goal range, campaigns below $4999 range has the totals count of 720 projects and the number successful outcome is 529 which is 73% of successful rate. But the goal ranges from $5000 to $19999, the successful outcome is 144 (54%) counts and the failed outcome is 121 (46%) counts out of 265 total projects in that goal range. Furthermore, goal range from $20000 and above, the successful outcome is 21 (36%) counts and the failed outcome is 37 (64%) counts out of 58 total projects in that goal range, which shows the failed campaigns are higher than successful. Higher the goal ranges higher the failing rates outcomes.  

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

The reason for cancelation and failed rate is unknown. If the reasons are known, and enough evidence are available it will be easy make to predictions to make strategic decisions to improve the successful rate of the campaigns. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

Yearly wise table can give more in-depth view of the crowdfunding performance  and it will help to identify the underperforming categories and  the sub-categories in order to eliminate those campaigns in future and run the profitable ones.
